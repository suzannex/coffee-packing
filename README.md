Accomplished
- read inputs
- put all bags into boxes with no overlap
- valid # of boxes returned
Algorithm/heuristic used: Put boxes next to each other
where they will fit, in the first location where they will fit.
Fixed bag orientation (no rotation to find possible fits)

Next Steps (one at a time)
1. Rotate bags in each spot to find any possible fit

2. Choose the best orientation for a bag based on how much space it will waste
